Students and schools share common ideas of science as an ancient body of factual knowledge acquired by scientists in the western world. This knowledge is seen as fixed, something that cannot be challenged, or will ever change. The teacher is expected to explain and the student is expected to learn this without asking questions. Assessment of science thus becomes a matter of testing how much is remembered. Often, it is only the student with the best memorization ability who \u2018tops\u2019 the class, every year and in every discipline. This result only demonstrates that the test assesses only the skill of memorisation and reproduction. True scientific activity requires far more.<\/p>\r\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/thescienceschool.edu.pk\/webportal\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/science-2.jpg\" class=\"img-left img-responsive img-rounded\">The Science School recognizes the growing, changing, nature of science. The Science School hopes to create an environment for science as active investigation and problem solving in the context of our own needs. We hope to develop sound concepts, build skills and move learning and teaching out of the lecture room to the laboratory and real life contexts where they belong. Mathematics learning is given great importance and efforts are made to integrate experiences of both science and mathematics wherever possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>The Science School endeavors to embrace academic excellence through qualities such as intellectual curiosity, rigor, skepticism, courage, perseverance, compassion, honesty, respect for all and most importantly, through a sense of fun.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The Science School takes an integrated, holistic approach to the development of Pakistan\u2019s young scientists. Our Curriculum seeks active inspiration, support and guidance from Pakistan\u2019s Science, Engineering and Technology organizations. An example is the development of Learning Units in Geography by SUPARCO\u2019s professionals using state of the art satellite imagery, and the support to development of Design and Technology curriculum through NESCOM.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n      <\/div>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-7bab25d elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"7bab25d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Mathematics<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f7a8a75 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"f7a8a75\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix\"><p>The Science School Mathematics Curriculum, in line with the mission of the school, aspires to develop high quality understanding and skill in mathematics.

The Science School believes in providing both challenge and support in a rich, intense, and integrated, mathematics experience at all levels.<\/p><p>Scientists and engineers approach problem solving with a goal of optimizing a solution to a problem, as opposed to proving that a problem is solved. Good quality mathematics learning at The Science School helps students to develop critical understanding of process as well as develop sound concepts. At The Science School, mathematics lessons are challenging and fun for both teachers and students. In the best constructivist tradition, students build knowledge and understanding through active involvement with prior understanding and the challenge of ever more complex ideas. Students seek patterns, solve problems and build awareness of their own mental processes through talk and communication in the language of mathematics.<\/p><p>Students develop the ability to listen, question and discuss as well as to read and record their mathematical experiences.

It is a subject assessed by International General Certificate of Secondary Education UK (IGCSE) among others. The Science School has introduced Design and Technology in Pakistan as an essential area of study relating to our goal of developing young Scientists and Engineers. The IGCSE Syllabus encourages students to \u201cidentify, consider and solve problems through creative thinking, planning and design, and by working with different media, materials and tools.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"mob_txt_12\">As the name suggests, Design and Technology, enables students to think creatively and critically, learn research skills, plan and conduct investigations in a range of different and interesting areas. Students will work through the cycle of creative thinking, analysis, and synthesis. They will work hands-on with materials, use technology and learn to communicate effectively.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"mob_txt_12\">Design itself is a complex activity. Concepts and principles of design are incorporated with a study of materials and technology as well as innovative ideas for the use of energy.

We do not believe that the scientist functions in a vacuum, distant from the concerns of everyday life. Decision making is seen as a multifaceted enterprise with knowledge of faith, the world, people, and man\u2019s place in society. A scientist does not just make decisions in the domain of science. These decisions are nested in the wider concerns of purpose, morals, ethics, economics, practicalities and above all, belief. Scientists who conduct science for materialistic goals with disregard to values and faith can be found everywhere in the world. The Science School, as a proud project of\u00a0 our Scientific Strategic Organizations, maintains the importance of human activity for higher goals and purposes.<\/p><p>The aim of the Islamiyat Curriculum is two fold. One, to prepare students for eventual study of the syllabus of O\u2019 Level Islamiyat of Cambridge International Examinations; Two, to use the context of Islamiyat to develop knowledge and understanding of Islam as a preparation for life.
